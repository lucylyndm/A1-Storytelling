            <h2>Subscriber Growth Over Time</h2>
            <p>
                Over the last decade, the streaming landscape has undergone a dramatic transformation. Netflix, once known
                primarily for mailing DVDs, firmly established itself as a global entertainment leader, growing from 62.7
                million subscribers in 2015 to over 301 million by the end of 2024. This unprecedented rise was fueled by its
                early investments in original content and a head start in international expansion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then came the challengers. In late 2019, Disney+ burst onto the scene, instantly capturing attention with its
                unmatched library of franchises — from Marvel and Star Wars to Pixar and National Geographic. By 2024, it had
                already surpassed 150 million subscribers, proving that strong content heritage could quickly earn loyalty in a
                crowded marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Amazon Prime Video carved out its own path. Unlike others, Prime Video was bundled into Amazon’s
                popular Prime membership, allowing it to grow steadily and quietly. By 2025, it had reached approximately 167
                million subscribers — a testament to the power of ecosystem bundling and consistent content offerings.

            <h2>Content Spending Comparison</h2>
            <p>
                The battle for streaming supremacy hasn’t just been about subscriber numbers — it’s also been a war waged
                through content budgets. As competition intensified, platforms began pouring billions into original
                programming, acquisitions, and exclusive deals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Netflix led the charge, ramping up its content spending from $15 billion in 2019 to an estimated $18 billion
                in 2024. Its strategy of producing a wide range of global, genre-spanning content aimed to serve every
                taste — from Oscar-winning films to binge-worthy reality shows.
            </p>
            <p>
                Disney+ wasn’t far behind. Backed by its colossal catalog and creative studios, Disney increased its
                investment from $10 billion to $15 billion in the same timeframe, emphasizing cinematic-quality storytelling
                across its core franchises and newer original series.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prime Video, while more reserved, still made impressive strides. With content spending rising from $7 billion
                to $12 billion, Amazon focused on marquee events like “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” and live
                sports integrations, reinforcing its position as a premium player.

            <h2>Timeline of Key Events</h2>
            <p>
                The evolution of streaming has been shaped by bold moves and pivotal moments. In 2013, Netflix made its first
                major leap into original programming with the release of “House of Cards,” setting the tone for what would
                become a gold standard in streaming innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward to 2019, Disney officially entered the ring with the launch of Disney+. The platform's arrival
                disrupted the balance of power, offering a competitive alternative that catered to families and superfans
                alike. One year later, in 2020, the streaming battlefield expanded further with the launch of HBO Max and
                Peacock, each bringing their unique content identities into the mix.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 2022, with growth slowing and competition rising, Netflix made a strategic pivot — launching an
                ad-supported subscription tier aimed at price-sensitive viewers, signaling a new chapter in its business
                model. Then, in 2023, it doubled down on live entertainment, announcing a $5 billion deal to stream WWE’s
                Monday Night Raw starting in 2025 — a clear step into sports broadcasting and appointment viewing.

            <h2>The Future of Streaming</h2>
            <p>
                As the dust settles from the early battles of the streaming war, a new phase begins — one marked not just by
                competition, but by evolution. With market saturation looming in North America and Europe, streaming platforms
                are now turning toward innovation, partnerships, and global growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The future of streaming will likely be shaped by diversification. Advertising-based tiers will continue to
                grow, offering more flexible pricing. Platforms are expanding into live sports, gaming, and even interactive
                content to deepen engagement. Meanwhile, some companies may consolidate — merging libraries and reducing
                fragmentation — to improve profitability and simplify user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the next chapter won't be defined solely by who has the most subscribers, but by who can offer the
                most compelling, convenient, and personalized experience — one that earns not just attention, but loyalty.
